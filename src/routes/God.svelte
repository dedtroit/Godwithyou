					Tell me if you heard this one before... In the beginning,
					God created the heavens and the earth. Or the "guy" who
					watches over us. Or the man upstairs. God. He is a living,
					God. is not a God, the God. He is the beginning and the end.
					The one who loves you so much He sent his son to die for
					you! To... die... for... you. He has given you the gift of
					eternal life if you chose to accept this gift. How do you
					receive this gift though? Well, first who is Jesus? He is
					the son of God but He is also God. Jesus came to this earth
					not as a good teacher or just a good person but as a perfect
					and holy, fully human and fully God to take on this world's
					sin as His own. Jesus died for your sins. Lying, stealing,
					murders, pornification, affairs, pedophilia. You name it
					Jesus died for it. and because of this, he has given you the
					right to go to heaven AND have a personal relationship with
					God, the one who created the heavens and earth, the one who
					created you and every microcell that exists in your body,
					the one who gives life to all living things. But the story
					doesn't end there. Jesus died for you and your sins but He
					rose again on the third day and invites everyone and anyone
					to accept the free gift. Now, how do you accept this gift?
					You must ask God for forgiveness for your sins. Believe that
					Jesus is God and that He rose again on the third day. And
					finally, turn your life away from evil. God loves you. He
					loves you more than every single person's love combined. I
					mean, who would die for you? Take their life. Like, they are
					done. Plus, take every wrong you have ever done and say you
					are clean and give you a life in heaven. No one even has the
					capability of doing this.
					<div class="spacer" />
					If this is something you want to do pray this prayer: "God, I
					am a sinner and I am sorry for everything I have done in my life
					I know and believe that you are the one true God and that you
					sent your son to die for my sins. I believe that You and Jesus
					are one. And that he died on the cross and rose again. Make me
					new and turn my life around. Amen" The next step is continuing 
					after God and getting connected to a local church. We will also 
					be praying for you.
