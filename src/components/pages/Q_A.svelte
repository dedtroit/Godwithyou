    <h3>Why'd you make the website this way?</h3>
    <h4>
      Well, I don't like 'following the norm' so here we are on a sliding right

    <h3>What's your process?</h3>
    <h4>
      This entails a simple three step process.<br />
      First we set a meeting to go over whats best for you. Next the pre-production
      begins and planning starts (You just sit back and relax for this).<br />
      After this, we go over the plan with you and start production. The last step,
      post-production where the vision is stiched together <br />
      once polished and complete it is then sent off to you all good to go.
